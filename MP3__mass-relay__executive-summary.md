# MP3 — Mass Relay (mass-relay) — Executive Summary

**Mass Relay** is an AI Software Factory that makes AI systems reusable, operable, governable, observable, and testable by default.

## What It Delivers
- A normalized **Foundation** built once
- Domain **Projects** configured on top
- Governed AI behavior via **Agent Playbooks**
- Full observability via Run-centric tracing
- A read-only **Factory Control Room (Beta)**

## Co-developed Validation Project
**Ops Automation Studio (Project A)** exercises the full Foundation surface, including governed write-backs and HITL.

## Tech Posture
- Next.js UI
- TypeScript control plane
- Python as governed execution lane
- Postgres + object storage
- Workflow engine concept
- OpenTelemetry-style observability
