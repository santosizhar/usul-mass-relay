# Mass Relay — Track H — Codex Checklist


## Codex Intro Prompt (MANDATORY)

Repo: mass-relay

Read first:
- MP1__mass-relay__chat1-masterprompt.md
- MP2__mass-relay__chat2-transformer.md
- MP3__mass-relay__executive-summary.md
- docs/foundation-tracks-development/mass-relay__roadmap.md

Hard locks:
- Prompt Pack = MP1 / MP2 / MP3 only
- Runtime units = Agent Playbooks
- Foundation ≠ Projects (no cross-imports)
- Control plane = TypeScript
- Python = governed execution lane only
- Control Room = read-only
- Every operation emits a Run

Track specialization:
- Reference project

## Sprint H1 — Config & playbooks

Objective:
- Complete Track H Sprint H1 deliverables at execution-grade quality.

Codex tasks:
1. Implement all artifacts required for this sprint exactly as defined by the roadmap and governing contracts.
2. Ensure all new artifacts are deterministic, traceable, and versionable.
3. Add tests, fixtures, or checks that prove the sprint’s artifacts behave as intended.
4. Update documentation describing the artifacts, boundaries, and known limitations.

Constraints:
- No scope expansion beyond this sprint.
- No cross-track or cross-layer violations.
- No silent changes to previously agreed contracts.

Primary paths:
- apps/ (UI-only sprints)
- packages/ (Foundation modules)
- projects/ (Reference project only)
- docs/
- artifacts/

Acceptance criteria:
- All sprint artifacts exist in the expected locations.
- All tests/checks pass.
- Documentation is updated and internally consistent.
