# Mass Relay — Track E — Codex Checklist

## Codex Intro Prompt (MANDATORY)

You are working in repo **mass-relay**.

Before making any change, you MUST read:
- MP1__mass-relay__chat1-masterprompt.md
- MP2__mass-relay__chat2-transformer.md
- MP3__mass-relay__executive-summary.md
- mass-relay__roadmap.md

Hard locks:
- “Prompt Pack” refers ONLY to MP1 / MP2 / MP3
- Runtime units are Agent Playbooks
- Foundation ≠ Projects (no cross-imports)
- Control plane = TypeScript
- Python = governed execution lane only
- Control Room is read-only
- Every operation emits a Run

Track specialization:
- This checklist applies ONLY to this track
- Do not modify unrelated tracks
