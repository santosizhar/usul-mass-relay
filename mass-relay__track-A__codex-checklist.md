# Mass Relay — Track A — Codex Checklist

## Codex Intro Prompt (MANDATORY)

Repo: **mass-relay**

Read first:
- MP1__mass-relay__chat1-masterprompt.md
- MP2__mass-relay__chat2-transformer.md
- MP3__mass-relay__executive-summary.md
- mass-relay__roadmap.md

Hard locks:
- Prompt Pack = MP1 / MP2 / MP3 only
- Runtime units = Agent Playbooks
- Foundation ≠ Projects (no cross-imports)
- Control plane = TypeScript
- Python = governed execution lane
- Control Room = read-only
- Every operation emits a Run

## A1 — Build

Scope:
- Implement sprint per roadmap
- Respect track boundaries

Primary paths:
- See roadmap-defined modules

Expected artifacts:
- Code + docs per sprint
